<h3>App File</h3>
<p>
Every EpicMvc package included in the application will have some file where it will attach the controller's configuration structure on to the <code>E.app$</code> namespace as <code>E.app$pkgNm</code> where <code>pkgNm</code> is the name of the package it is associated with. Typically this file will be called <mark>app.coffee</mark> and located at the top level of the package's directory.
</p>

<p>
A minimal <mark>app.coffee</mark> file will have the following structure and installed on to the app namespace as follows:
</p>

<pre>
E.app$myPkg=
   SETTINGS: go: 'starter_flow//', layout: 'default_layout'
   MODELS:
      MyModel: class: 'MyModel', inst: 'mM', fists: [ 'login']
   FLOWS:
      starter_flow:
         start: "starter_track"
         TRACKS:
            starter_track:
               start: "starter_step"
               STEPS:
                  starter_step: page: "my_cool_page"
</pre>
