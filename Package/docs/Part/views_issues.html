<h3>Issues and Messages: mapping return tokens to user friendly text</h3>
<p>
The JavaScript developer returns all user errors as 'tokens.' These tokens are then mapped by EpicMvc to user readable text.
The <mark>issues.coffee</mark> file contains all mapping of issue tokens, to user text, and allows also for parameters to be included in the text. </p>
<p>
For example, if an item is out of stock, but the item name needs to be included in the error message, then the developer might return the token "OUT_OF_STOCK" along with a parameter value of "Blues Clues Treasure Chest".
The map for this issue in the <mark>issues.coffee</mark> file might be: "Sorry <code>%1%</code> is out of stock."
</p>

<p>
Issues can also be specialized by application, such that the same 'OUT_OF_STOCK' token can have its own text, when it occurs while placing an item in a wish-list vs. putting the item in the cart - or when the item goes out of stock after the user is in the checkout process.
</p>
<p>Issues and Messages are organized in a filed named issues.coffee</p>

<legend>issues.coffee <span style="font-size: 11px; font-weight: normal;" class="label label-primary">coffeescript</span></legend>
