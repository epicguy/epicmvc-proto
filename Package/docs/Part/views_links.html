<h3>Links and Navigation</h3>
<p>
This section explains how to make clickable links throughout your app.  Links that are outside of forms, can be hyperlinks on text or on images.
For these, we use the tag <code>&lt;epic:link_action&gt;</code>.
The HTML must be aware of the values needed to process an action, and provide these on the tag along with an action label.
If you must pass data in a form, you will instead need to use a form button within a form, so that the form data will be posted by the browser.
This requires a different tag <code>&lt;epic:form_action&gt;</code> and this is documented in the next section called
<a class="link" data-action="click:go_views_forms" href="#forms_fields_buttons">Forms, form fields, and buttons.</a>
</p>
<p>
The <code>&lt;epic:link_action&gt;</code> tag does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> require you to specify which page to display next.
The only information needed is (a) a unique name for this action used later to connect to the business logic, and (b) any values to pass to that action.
Suppose you wish to create a link in the current application, which will log the user out. This may be done like this:
<code>&lt;epic:link_action action="logout" /&gt;</code> - the app.coffee file will contain a CLICK entry that maps your action called 'logout' to the proper JavaScript logic module used to effect a logout.
Additionally, the app.coffee file will determine which page would naturally be displayed next, after this occurred.
</p>
<p>
Typically, a link appears inside an <code>&lt;epic:foreach&gt;</code> loop, such that each link is supposed to reference a different row of data.
For example, suppose you have a list of people to send an email to, and the link is designed to send an email to just one of those addresses.
A combination of the <code>&lt;epic:foreach&gt;</code> and an <code>&lt;epic:link_action&gt;</code> would be used, however this time a parameter must be included, which names the recipient.
The HTML might look like this:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;h3&gt;Send email to one of the following:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;epic:foreach table="ListMaintainer/Recipients"&gt;
	&lt;epic:link_action action="send_email" p:recipient="&amp;Recipients/email;"&gt;&amp;Recipients/email;&lt;/epic:link_action&gt;
&lt;/epic:foreach&gt;
</pre>
<h4>Via data attributes</h4>
<pre>
&lt;h3&gt;Send email to one of the following:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;epic:foreach table="ListMaintainer/Recipients"&gt;
	&lt;a data-action="click:send_email" data-params="{'recipient':'&amp;Recipients/email;'}"&gt;&amp;Recipients/email;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/epic:foreach&gt;
</pre>
<p>Later in the app.coffee file, there would be instructions such as:</p>
<pre>
CLICKS:
	send_email:	call: 'ListMaintainer/send', use_fields: 'recipient', RESULTS: [
		{ r:{}, go: 'home/main/send_confirm' }
	]
</pre>
