<h3>MODELS</h3>
<p><code>MODELS</code> is a top level key of the Controller structure and is used to define the Models (JavaScript Business Logic Classes) that are to be used in the application.
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<pre>
E.app$myPkg=
	MODELS:
		League:		class: 'League',	inst: 'mpLg', fists: 'EditPlayer,AddPlayer'
		Wist:		class: 'Wist',		inst: 'mpW'
		Self:		class: 'Self',		inst: 'mpU'
		User:		class: 'Self',		inst: 'mpU' # Alias for Self Model
</pre>

<h4>Define a Model</h4>
<p>
A Model is made available by defining it as a key under MODELS. This key is the name that will be used by the View and Controller when referencing the Model e.g <code>League</code> or <code>User</code>. The <code>class:</code> attribute is the name of the Javascript Class in code where the business logic resides, and the <code>inst:</code> attribute is the name of the instance created after calling <code>new</code> on the Javascript class.
</p>

<h4>Associate Forms (Fists) to a Model</h4>
<p>
Forms (actually a 'list of fields' called a 'fist') are associated with a Model by using the <code>fists:</code> attribute and declaring the names of the Fists in a comma separated string. When a form needs to be posted or populated, the controller will ask the Model associated with the form to do the work.
</p>

<h4>Creating a Model Alias</h4>
<p>
It is possible to create an Alias name for a Model. In the example above, <code>User</code> is an alias for <code>Self</code>, where both refer to the same instance of the 'Self' class.
</p>

<h4>Built-in EpicMvc Models</h4>
<p>EpicMvc has a few built-in Models that are made available to you. They are defined in the Base Package app.coffee file and are merged in to the App Controller at run time.
</p>
<pre>
E.app$Base=
	MODELS:
		App:  class: "App$Base",  inst: "iBaseApp"		# Exposes controller values to the Views, and actions to control page-flow
		View: class: "View$Base", inst: "iBaseView"		# Implements the logic associated with all the special html tags and vars
		Fist: class: "Fist$Base", inst: "iBaseFist"		# 'Field list' business logic for e.g. 2-way binding and validation
		Tab:  class: "Tab$Base",  inst: "iBaseTab"		# View-state for Bootstrap type HTML things, such as Tabs, dropdowns, popups
		Wist: class: "Wist$Base", inst: "iBaseWist"		# 'Word list' model to read a static file of data and expose as view-tables
</pre>
