<h3>SETTINGS</h3>
<p><code>SETTINGS</code> is a top level key of the Controller structure and is used to define various settings and defaults for the app.
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<pre>
E.app$myPkg=
	SETTINGS:
		go: 	'anon//'							# Defaults to 'default//'
		layout:	'logged_out'						# Defaults to 'default'
		modals: popup: 'modal_popup', pop:'pop'
		frames: '000_refresh': 'refresh'
</pre>

<h4>go:</h4>
<p>The <code>go:</code> option is used to tell the Controller which flow/track/step to start the application under.
</p>

<h4>layout:</h4>
<p>
The <code>layout:</code> setting is used to define the file name of the default HTML layout.

<h4>modals:</h4>
<p>Modal layouts that will be used in the application. In the example above, <code>popup</code> is the name for the modal that will be referenced by the Controller within the Flow, and <code>'modal_popup'</code> is the name of the file on disk <mark>Layout/modal_popup.html</mark> that holds the HTML for that modal.
</p>

<h4>frames:</h4>
<p>The <code>frames:</code> setting is used to define additional layouts that are all accumulative across any 'app' controller files. Sorted by key e.g. <code>000_refresh</code> and loaded from the file e.g. <code>Layout/refresh.html</code>. This might be used, for example, to add a popup for when the application has been updated, and requires the user to press 'refresh'.
