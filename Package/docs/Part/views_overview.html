<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
	EpicMvc was designed with the goal of separating the business logic from the HTML that is displayed. The run time engine will handle rendering what is needed for the browser while the 'Controller' is responsible for telling the engine which pieces of HTML should be stitched together and presented to the User. Because of this, the 'View' can be designed in smaller more manageable pieces without the HTML developer having to worry about the Flow of the application. Different 'Templates' can be designed for the same 'Page', while 'Parts' can be easily included or ripped out from anywhere with a sinlge line of code and without worrying about breaking the functionality of the application.
</p>
<p>
	At run time, EpicMvc will load the initial index.html file for the application and will insert the current 'Template' and 'Page' html in to the 'body' based on the current Step in the 'Flow,Track,Step' system of the 'Controller'.
