<h3>RESULTS</h3>
<p>
	When a 'Model' is called with an action, the 'Controller' might be interested in the result and want to perform additional 'Model' actions or modify the pageflow based on the result. This is accomplished by using the <code>RESULTS:[]</code> attribute when calling a Model. When a 'Model' has completed an 'action', EpicMvc will return a result object back to the 'Controller'. The 'Controller' can then look for specific values attached to this result object to decide what should happen next.
</p>
<p>
	The <code>RESULTS:</code> attribute is a list of instructions, where each instruction contains the key <code>r:</code> which in turn has a set of key/value pairs defined. The 'Controller' will walk through the RESULTS array attempting to find a matching instruction for the result object that came back from the 'Model' based on the key/value pairs defined in 'r:' for an instruction. Once an insruction is found to have a match, it will execute the instruction as if it were a 'CLICK'. If <code>r:</code> is defined as an empty object, the 'Controller' will execute that instruction no matter what the result of the Model is.
</p>
<p>
	An instruction object can contain <code>go:</code> commands as well as <code>call:</code> commands that contain nested 'RESULTS' arrays. Using this method, the 'Controller' can execute multiple 'CLICKS' chained together on behalf of the User without the User having to do any work at all.

<h4>Example</h4>
<pre>
CLICKS:
	login: call: 'User/login', use_form: 'Login', RESULTS: [
		{ r:{success:'SUCCESS'},			go: 'logged_in//' }
		{ r:{success:'FAIL', is_registered: 'NO'},	go: 'logged_out/sign_up/'}
		{ r:{success:'FAIL', is_registered: 'YES'},	go: 'logged_out/forgot_password/'}
	]
	logout: call: 'User/logout', RESULTS: [
		{ r:{}, go: 'logged_out//' }
	]
</pre>
